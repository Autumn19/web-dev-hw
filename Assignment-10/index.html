      <h1>Soil</h1>
      <h2>Andisols</h2>

    <div class="text">
        <p>There are 12 main soils: Alfisols, Andisols, Aridisols, Entisols, Endisols, Histisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Oxisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Vertisols. Andisols is one of the rarest of the 12 main soils.Volcanic soils like Andisols have a very meaningful ability in this world. Supporting a large life cycle by the nutrients it holds. It’s found in cooler, more volcanic areas like Hawaii. Its ability to provide food for plants and animals and also provide agricultural environments for mankind. We will be discussing what it is, what its made of, how it is formed, where it is, how ts supports mankind, and the flora and fauna of these soils. </p>
        <p>Andisols is from the Japanese area, mainly called “black soil”. It forms from weathered volcanic material such as ash. The minerals in the soil have a poor crystal structure but have an unusually high capacity to hold nutrients and water, making these soils very productive and fertile. Andisols also includes weathered soils that include volcanic glass. They mostly occur in areas that have high rainfall and cool temperatures. They usually have an Ah, Bw, and C horizon. The Ah horizon is usually darker and higher in organic matter, but the B horizon is usually dominate. The soils development depends on the areas they are located. In rainfall areas and other wetter areas the pH usually has a lower pH than 4.9. In drier conditions there is less weathering the pH is higher.</p>
    <p>These soils support a high human population today to help grow prosperous foods because they are found in colder mountain areas, which is generally free of pests and diseases. The success of mankind on andisols is largely due to the soil and climatic environment. Though phosphorus availability is a problem, their is usually a significant supply for most needs. The soils are friable and well drained so tillage is not a problem. As these soils have been used for generations, conservation practices have been installed in most situations. </p>
