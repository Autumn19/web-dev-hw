      <p>Conservation is a topic many people don't agree with or yet understand. In my opinion people thrive off of natural and sustainable recources, but also respecting our recources is esential for our future generations.
        Earth has many recources like: air, plants, water, soil, and wildlife. "Conservation is the care and protection of these resources so that they can persist for future generations. It includes maintaining diversity of species, genes, and ecosystems, as well as functions of the environment, such as nutrient cycling."
        Conseration accomplishes different tasks like sustainability, for example hunting wild game and loggin timber. But conservation is also similar to preservation, which protects nature from human use. (National Geographics)
