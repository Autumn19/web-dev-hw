      <h3>Most Delicious French Toast</h3>
      <p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and finding fun, easy and delicious meals to make tops the cake. I chose to make these delious Bananas Foster French Toast because they are more of a confert food for me. My mother would make French Toast usually on holidays. The most perfect morning with the blinds open all through out the house, fresh coffee brewing and mama in the kitchen making French Toast for all the kids.</p>
      <p>I found this recipe on pinterest, and this one is by far the best I've had ever created.</p>
