      <p>I chose this topic because I am a hunter anda future forester an strongly believe in conservation. I believe everything has a balance. Keeping animal population at normal numbers instead of them exceeding or decreasing. Also as a future forester thinning projects are extremely benaficial for the health of our environment. Thinning prevents wildfires, prevents over crowding, but also helps new growth exceed as well.
